# track_simulation

This is a simulation demonstrating autonomous agents and their ability to revisualize races from race split times. 
The agents are also able to simulate races and competitively respond to one another. The simulations use d3.js.

The agents will run a given length race as either a revisualization of a previous competition, or they can simulate a race between two competitors who have never faced based on splits from selected races. The agents can also "run" continuously, simulating pacing and competitive positioning.
